Help
-------

If you've got problems importing the project into Eclipse, you can do it by following these steps:

1. Open console (cmd.exe) and type "git clone https://github.com/jjhaggar/ludum30_a_hole_new_world.git"

2. Make a plain text file called "local.properties" with the location of your android SDK. For example: 
sdk.dir=C:/ProgramFiles/adt-bundle-windows-x86/sdk)

3. Open Eclipse and click on "File>Import>Gradle Project", browse to the folder where you cloned the repository and then on "Build Model", after that you'll be able to import the 4 projects into your workspace (although html doesn't work right now).
 
If you've got any other question feel free to ask ;)
